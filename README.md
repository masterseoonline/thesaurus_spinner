# thesaurus_spinner
Synyonim replacer based on public DICT dictionaries

Prototype !

I've exported this from a private project of mine, something might missing and autoloading needs to be set

DICT dictionaries are taken from [(here) https://sourceforge.net/projects/lyxwininstaller/files/thesaurus/], parsed and saved into a SQL database for fast loading
